# Spam vs Ham Email Classifier (2019)
Tools: Python (numpy, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib), Jupyter Notebooks

* Split the email data into training and test set
* Cleaned data by replacing NaN values, standardizing capital letters, removing line breaks, removing multiple spaces, and removing stopwords
* Used a logistic regression classifier to test the accuracy of the model to check if model was classifying the emails as spam or ham
* Improved accuracy through amount of punctuation in the email, amount of characters in the email subject and body, and amount of unique words used in each email
